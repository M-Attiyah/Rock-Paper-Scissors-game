understand the problem
- create program that can user enter one of (rock, paper, scissors)
  and the computer select one, then compare the two selections
  to get the winner, if compter win print "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"

plan
  * does the program have an interface ? what will look like ?
    the program will be in browser

  * what inputs your program have ?
    the user will enter selection in prompt
  
  * what's the desired output ?
    the user enter selection, and the computer choose random 
    selection, and then take the two selections, and compare 
    them to get the winner
    the final result must be 'You loose, rock beats scissors'
    or 'You win, scissors beats paper
  
  * given your inputs. what is the steps necessary to return the desired output ?
    * computer
      - create function 'computerSelection'
      - declare variable and store into it array
      - the array must have 3 values ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
      - declare variable to create random select, and choose the array to be the main source of selections 
      - return the selection 

    * player
      - create function 'playerSelection'
      - declare variable and store the prompt into it 
      - make the value case sensetive
        - check if the value like (rock, ROCK, RocK)
        - return the value with lowercase 
      - return the variable 

    * playRound
      * the main idea from creating this function, 
        it can make conditions and return different outputs
        - create function 'playRound'
        - store the computer, player values into a two variables
        - Start the conditions
          - if computer === player -> 'Tie Game'
          - if computer === 'rock' & player === 'scissors' -> 'You Lose, rock beats scissors'
          - if computer === 'scissors' & player === 'paper' -> 'You Lose, scissors beats paper'
          - if computer === 'paper' & player === 'rock' -> 'You Lose paper beats rock'
          - otherwise -> 'Your input must be (rock or paper or scissors)'
    
    * game 
      * the main idea from creating this function,
        it will count the rounds, and if end, will print the winner

      * the main problem here is, when call the function in loop 
        it return the value 5 times, not iteration

      *** i founded the solution, is declare the prompt in loop block, to iterate

        - create for loop block with, (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
        - declare two variables to track the points for computer and player
        - call the playerSelection function inside the loop block 
        - if the loop number is 5, check which one have higher points
          - if player > computer -> 'You Win'
          - otherwise -> 'You lose'
